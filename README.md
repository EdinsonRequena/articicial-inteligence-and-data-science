### Description
Here you can find resources, exercises and concepts ordered by difficulty. The repository is mainly based on [Platzi](https://platzi.com/)'s Data Science career, but there are also resources taken from my classes at university, Edx courses, [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), YouTube, blogs and exercises created by me.

## Collaboration
<!-- we can do something like this https://dev.to/doctolib/make-your-first-pull-request-to-an-open-source-project-1m57, for people who have no experience with github -->
There are still many topics to post. I do my best to upload content every day, if you want to collaborate by adding more exercises or in any other way, you are free to do so.

### Description
Here you can find resources, exercises and concepts ordered by difficulty. The repository is mainly based on [Platzi](https://platzi.com/)'s Data Science career, but there are also resources taken from my classes at university, Edx courses, [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), YouTube, blogs and exercises created by me.
